# Retinal Dystrophies: Data Analysis & Prediction

This project focuses on analyzing gene/protein activity data associated with **Retinal Dystrophies**, a group of genetic disorders that impair retinal function and lead to vision loss. The analysis includes **pathway-specific investigations** to identify key biological mechanisms and leverages **machine learning models** to predict the likelihood of Retinal Dystrophies based on gene/protein activity patterns.
